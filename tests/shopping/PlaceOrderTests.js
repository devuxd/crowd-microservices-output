// The last step in online purchasing is checking out the shopping cart. The information of a cart must be fetched from the database by the information of the user (each userId only has one cart). The function should calculate the summation of prices of items in the shopping cart. If the summation is zero it shows user does not have any item in the shopping cart, the function should return a meaningful response. All information of the user like the first name, last name is available in the database that function can fetch them based on 'userId'. The function for finalizing the order create an order data type object then store it in the database (FYI: a subroutine which is NOT part of this function reads order objects hourly and complete them). The function should call 3rd party persistence library for deleting the items in the shopping cart, because items in the shopping cart are purchased. The function is also responsible for checking the validity of all input arguments if one of them is invalid the function a 'TypeError' exception should be thrown with a description. Apparently the user already logged in the system then is trying to check out the shopping cart, the function should store a log from the items that the user added to the shopping cart, this log is useful for future item recommendations. The function may make use of a 3rd party persistence library.
